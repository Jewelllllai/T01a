<strong>Use of GitHub Copilot</strong>
<br>For this project, I have utilized  GitHub Copilot to help me in building these interactive and creative website. It provided code suggestions and helped me achieve the intended designs for both HTML and CSS.I also used it to explain and clarify certain parts in my code to enhance my understanding of each line of codes.<br>

<strong>Reflection</strong>
<br>GitHub Copilot has significantly aided my learning process by generating code snippets that enabled me to quickly grasp the fundamentals of website development. This save me a significant amount of time as I did not have to begin the entire work from scratch. However, I realised that the contents and deisgns generated by Copilot might be similar to other who also rely on Copilot for their work. Therefore, it is still important for me to customise the design and think of some other contents to make my work stands out. Additionally, some of the resources provided such as the navigation link provided may be outdated and have not been updated for some time. Thus, I must verify the accuracy and reliablility before using them. In conclusion, I agree AI tools are very powerful assets that enhanced my productivity and reduce development time while still require the user to apply them wisely and responsibly.
