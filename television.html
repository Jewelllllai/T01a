        <h2>Television Energy Consumption in Australia</h2>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>
                Televisions are a common appliance in Australian homes and can impact your household’s energy consumption. 
                Choosing an energy-efficient TV helps reduce electricity bills and environmental impact. 
                Look for the Energy Rating Label when buying a new television.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modern LED and OLED TVs use significantly less energy than older plasma or CRT models.</li>
                <li>Screen size affects energy use: larger TVs generally consume more power.</li>
                <li>Standby mode can account for up to 10% of a TV’s annual energy use. Turn off TVs at the wall to save energy.</li>
                <li>Australian households can compare TV models using the Energy Rating Label, which shows star ratings and estimated annual energy consumption (kWh/year).</li>
                <li>Energy-efficient televisions help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower electricity bills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When shopping for a new television, consider not only the purchase price but also the long-term energy costs. Look for features such as automatic brightness adjustment, energy-saving modes, and low standby power consumption.
